This document contains my answer to Adalab's Module 2 Evaluation for the Data Analytics Part-Time Bootcamp.

Technologies used: SQL (basic and advanced queries, subqueries, filters, etc.)

Each question is identified and followed by an SQL statement.

The file is originally a MySQL file that can be viewed in VS Code.

As an educational assignment, the purpose is to keep learning.

Thank you for your feedback!
